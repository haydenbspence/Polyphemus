## Introduction

The main goal of Polyphemus is to provide a collection of LLMs that are localized to functional areas. We use a varient of the village analogy in the paper [*Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior*]([file:///C:/Users/diana/Downloads/2304.03442.pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)) to describe our methodology.
Instead of a village, we draw the analogy to a Research Park where each fine-tuned LLM is an individual researcher in the park. Each of their qualities are described as well as how they interact to solve complex research challenges.
