## Abstract

The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) is strategically positioned to profoundly influence the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to open science and observational medical research. An internal Google document leaked in early May 2023 underscores the potential of Open Source AI to outperform major technology firms in the sector. Open source and open science possess significant advantages over private entities and institutions, primarily the capability to organically set standards, foster collaboration, and enhance interoperability. The Polyphemus Project is an innovative proposal aimed at replicating and tailoring cutting-edge advancements in Open Source AI to suit the needs of observational medical research. By establishing comprehensive frameworks, offering educational materials, conducting evaluations, and providing infrastructural access, the project aspires to facilitate and encourage the integration and development of open-source AI tools and methodologies within the OHDSI community. This approach stands to democratize AI, advancing the field while bolstering the quality and inclusivity of observational medical research.
